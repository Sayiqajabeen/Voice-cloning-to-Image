# Voice Cloning to Image

## Overview
This project explores the innovative intersection of voice cloning and image generation. The system extracts features from a cloned voice and uses them to generate images that visually represent the speaker’s perceived characteristics or context. This implementation bridges audio and visual modalities, enabling creative and practical applications.

## Features
- **Voice Cloning**: Clone a voice using advanced neural networks.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract unique features from the cloned voice, such as pitch, tone, and cadence.
- **Image Generation**: Use the extracted features to guide the generation of images.
- **Customizable Outputs**: Tailor the image generation process to focus on specific aspects of the voice.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  torch
  torchaudio
  transformers
  librosa
  numpy
  matplotlib
  ```
- Image generation tools (e.g., DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or custom GANs).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Voice-Cloning-to-Image.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Voice-Cloning-to-Image
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Voice Cloning**:
   - Use the voice cloning module to clone a voice from an audio sample.
   - Extract features like pitch, tone, and timbre.
2. **Image Generation**:
   - Map the extracted features to parameters used by the image generation model.
   - Generate images that visually represent the voice characteristics.
3. **Visualization**:
   - View and analyze the generated images.

### Example Workflow
#### Input:
- An audio sample of a speaker.

#### Output:
- An image generated based on the voice’s features, such as:
  - A portrait reflecting the speaker’s perceived characteristics.
  - An abstract representation of the voice’s tonal qualities.

## How It Works
1. **Voice Cloning**:
   - Use a pre-trained voice cloning model to replicate the speaker’s voice.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Analyze the cloned voice to extract features like spectral properties and rhythm.
3. **Feature-to-Image Mapping**:
   - Map audio features to image generation parameters.
4. **Image Generation**:
   - Use an image generation model (e.g., GAN, DALL·E) to create the visual output.

## Applications
- **Creative Arts**: Generate artistic representations of voices.
- **Forensics**: Visualize voice characteristics for investigative purposes.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enhance multimodal interfaces with audio-visual connections.

## Customization
You can modify the project to:
- Use different voice cloning or image generation models.
- Focus on specific voice features for tailored image outputs.
- Integrate with real-time audio input for dynamic image generation.
